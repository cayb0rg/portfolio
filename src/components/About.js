      <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida. I gained an interest in programming after playing the game <i>Human Resource Machine</i>, and it's only been downhill from there.</p>
      <p>When I'm not sitting in front of a computer screen, I like exploring places on my bike and reading.</p>
